Recently, the long term capital gain has gained much attention because Biden administration is planning to increase the tax rate. 
The following diagram shows how the long term capital gain is taxed currently. (The short term is taxed as ordinary income.)

In case it is not super clear, here are the steps to compute the long term capital gain tax:

- Draw your regular income (wage, short term, etc. shown in pink in the digram)
- On top of it, draw your long term capital gain (including qualified dividend)
- Draw the dividing line between 0% and 15% long term capital gain rate which can be found in [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capital_gains_tax_in_the_United_States)
- Draw the dividing line between 15% and 20% long term capital gain rate
- You pay tax at x% rate for the capital gain in the x% region (if you have $1 in 20% region, then you just pay 20% on that $1)
- High income individuals (single with adjusted gross income $20,000, joint $250,000) will pay "Net Investment Income Tax", or NIIT, on form 8960. 

The House bill proposed to change the 20% rate to 25%, and slight lower the threshold ($400,000 for singles and $450,000 for married couples) according to [cnbc](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/09/15/house-capital-gains-tax-better-for-the-super-rich-than-biden-plan.html).
