Suppose you have excess contribution on year Y, you should ask your plan administrator to have the excess (a) plus earnings (b) taken out, suppose this happens at time T.

```
if T <= 12/31/Y then
   include (a + b) as income in year Y
else if 01/01/(Y+1) <= T <= 04/15/(Y+1) then
   include a as income in year Y
   include b as income in year Y+1
else if T > 04/15/(Y+1) then
   include a as income in year Y
   include (a + b) as income in year_of(T) /* Yes, double taxation on a */
   pay 10% early distribution penalty if applicable
end
```
