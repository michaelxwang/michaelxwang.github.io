title: Communication Protocol for Returning Clients
---

<html>
<body>

<p>
For <mark>returning clients</mark> whom we have established a mutual trust relationship with, we follow this four-layer communication protocol.
This simplified protocol aims to improve efficiency by only processing your documents once. This protocol has been successfully tested on a sample group and will be implemented more widely in the coming years.
</p>

<ul style="list-style-type:none;">
  <li>&rarr; [2a] You upload your tax documents according to the <a href="/cat/tax/2022/12/31/tax-check-list.html" target="_blank">checklist</a> (<mark>this is a clickable link</mark>) under {{ site.time | date: "%Y" | minus: 1 }} subfolder.
  If the folder does not exist, please create it. If you forget your link, please contact us and then bookmark it.</li>
  <li>&larr; [3b] We will prepare your tax return and upload it to the same location for verification.</li>
  <br>
  <li>&rarr; [4a] You can either tell me that you have verified everything and it's OK, or you can ask any questions you may have.</li>
  <li>&larr; [4b] We will send you an electronic signature request, or in rare cases, upload a signature document.</li>
  <br>
  <li>&rarr; [5a] You tell me that you have signed.</li>
  <li>&larr; [5b] We will electronically file your tax return, unless there is a rare case where it needs to be filed on paper.</li>
  <br>
  <li>&rarr; [6a] We will propose a below-market but sustainable price that is similar to or the same as last year's price. If you do not accept our proposed price, you may pay us any amount you prefer.
                  Please note that this will not affect the status of your tax return, as it has already been submitted in step [5b].</li>
  <li>&larr; [6b] We will acknowledge your payment.</li>
</ul>
