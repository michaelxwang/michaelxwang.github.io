<p>
&bull; For <mark>returning clients</mark> that we have established a mutual trust relationship, we folllow this four-layer communication protocal.
The simplified protocal is to improve efficiency that we only need to parse your document only once. It has been tested with great success on a sample and will be used more widely each year. 
</p>

<ul style="list-style-type:none;">
  <li>&rarr; [2a] You upload your tax documents according to the <a href="/cat/tax/2021/12/31/tax-check-list.html" target="_blank">checklist</a> (<mark>this is a clickable link</mark>) under {{ site.time | date: "%Y" }} subfolder. Create the folder if it does not exist. Ask me if you forget your link and then bookmark it.</li>
  <li>&larr; [3b] we prepare your tax return and upload to the same link for your verification.</li>
  <br>
  <li>&rarr; [4a] You tell me you have verified OK or you ask questions.</li>
  <li>&larr; [4b] we send you an electronic signature request (or we upload a signature document).</li>
  <br>
  <li>&rarr; [5a] You tell me that you have signed.</li>
  <li>&larr; [5b] we will submit your tax return electronically (or file on paper in rare cases).</li>
  <br>
  <li>&rarr; [6a] we will propose a blow the market but sustainable price same or similar to last year's price. If you do not accept, then pay me what you feel like. It won't affect your return as the die is cast in step [5b]. From economic point of view, we should accept any payment which is greater than zero.</li>
  <li>&larr; [6b] we acknowledge your payment.</li>
</ul>

<p>
&bull; For <mark>new clients</mark>, we can complete your return when time permits (off peak) and situation fits (no complex issues), we will follow this
six-layer communication protocol which has been tested by so many people over so many years.<br>
</p>

<ul style="list-style-type:none;">
  <li>&rarr; [1a] You provide me: ["Your <mark>Gmail</mark> address", "<mark>First name</mark>", "<mark>Last name</mark>"].</li>
  <li>&larr; [1b] we will send you a *secure* Google drive link for you to upload your tax documents.</li>
  <br>
  <li>&rarr; [2a] You upload your <mark>complete</mark> set of tax documents according to the <a href="/cat/tax/2021/12/31/tax-check-list.html" target="_blank">checklist</a> (<mark>this is a clickable link</mark>).</li>
  <li>&larr; [2b] we will tell if we can do it and if so we will provide a <mark>fixed</mark>, below the market price based on reporting items and how well the documents are organized, and an estimated completion time. Based on our past experience, we cannot provide an estimated quote without reviewing your documents.</li>
  <br>
  <li>&rarr; [3a] You tell me that you agree with the price.</li>
  <li>&larr; [3b] we prepare your tax return and upload to the same link for your verification.</li>
  <br>
  <li>&rarr; [4a] You tell me you have verified OK or you ask questions.</li>
  <li>&larr; [4b] we send you an electronic signature request (or we upload a signature document).</li>
  <br>
  <li>&rarr; [5a] You tell me that you have signed.</li>
  <li>&larr; [5b] we will submit your tax return electronically (or file on paper in rare cases).</li>
  <br>
  <li>&rarr; [6a] You pay me according to what we have agreed previously.</li>
  <li>&larr; [6b] we acknowledge your payment.</li>
</ul>

&bull; FAQ (TL;DR)

- Can you guarantee data security and privacy?

Yes, we have a Google Workspace account for "advanced security", and we recommend that you use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-factor_authentication" target="_blank">Multi-factor authentication (MFA)</a> to protect your Gmail account.
No, as an industry common practice, we will never reveal your information to anyone without your permission (except required by the law which has never happened in our practice).

- What is your and my responsibilties?

Like a software object has parameters and procedures, your return has two data and computations. The facts and original data are your responsibility, the application of law based on the facts and computation of data are ours.

- If I am audited, can you help me?

Yes, definietly. Every return we file carries a life time gurantee which includes:

-- Error correction. If we made an error, at our own expenses we will restore your return to the state that we have done it correctly in the first place. 

-- Audit representation. If it is our error and we cannot resolve the issue, we will refund your payment in full.

-- Loss recovery. If we have made an error which caused an irreversible economic loss, we will compensate you for the loss.

Fine prints: 

-- You must notify us any errors within 3 years of filing. 

-- You must notify and provide us the initial government notices within 60 days of issue.

- How do you set your price?

We determine our price not based on forms alone, but holistically on what you have, and how well your documents are organized.

Statistically, our price is within one standard deviation &sigma; below the market price mean &mu; taken that the market price as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution" target="_blank">normal distribution</a>, which is to say that you can find 50+ people who charge price above us, and 15.9% below us.

Here is an accidental, uninvited ["testimony"](/assets/images/20220207-price-of-conscience.jpeg){:target="_blank"} that happened in our possession in which a potential client inquires a returning client on our price, and both agreed that our pice is a price of conscience. 

- How can you keep the price below the market price?

Two reasons. Firstly with your cooperation by following the well established communication protocal and providing a complete and well organized set of facts and tax documents, and secondly due to [economy of skill](/cat/prose/2020/12/24/economy-of-skill.html){:target="_blank"}.

- Do you provide tax advice and planning?

Yes and no. We do not offer standalone tax advice and planning, our core business is to file personal tax returns and included in the service we answer all questions related to
your return, and on a best effort basis answer all tax related questions, up to next filing season. Most people find it suffice to act on their own with their questions answered. 

- Do you provide referral bonus?

Not any more. Preparing tax return is a time consuming and labor intensive job. We have passed the snowballing period, and now have more requests than we can meet.
