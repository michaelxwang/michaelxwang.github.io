<h2>The tax return workflow</h2>

<p>
The six-layer protocol has been tested by so many people over so many years.<br>
If you agree to follow the protocol, then let us get started.
</p>

<p>
Existing clients start from step [2a].
</p>

<ul style="list-style-type:none;">
  <li>&rarr; [1a] You provide me: ["Your <mark>Gmail</mark> address", "<mark>First name</mark>", "<mark>Last name</mark>"].</li>
  <li>&larr; [1b] I will send you a *secure* link for you to upload your tax documents.</li>
  <br>
  <li>&rarr; [2a] You upload your tax documents according to the <a href="/tax/2020/12/31/tax-check-list.html" target="_blank"> checklist</a>.</li>
  <li>&larr; [2b] I provide a fixed price based on low end market price minus a discount.</li>
  <br>
  <li>&rarr; [3a] You tell me that you agree with the price.</li>
  <li>&larr; [3b] I prepare your tax return and upload to the same link for your verification.</li>
  <br>
  <li>&rarr; [4a] You tell me you have verified OK or you ask questions.</li>
  <li>&larr; [4b] I send you an electronic signature request (or I upload a signature document).</li>
  <br>
  <li>&rarr; [5a] You tell me that you have signed.</li>
  <li>&larr; [5b] I will submit your tax return electronically (or file on paper in rare cases).</li>
  <br>
  <li>&rarr; [6a] You pay me according to what we have agreed previously.</li>
  <li>&larr; [6b] I acknowledge your payment.</li>
</ul>
