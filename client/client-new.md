title: Communication Protocol for New Client
---

<html>
<body>

<p>
For <mark>new clients</mark>, we can prepare your return when time and circumstances allow (e.g. off-peak season, no complex issues), we will follow this
six-step communication protocol which has been tested by so many people over so many years.<br>
</p>

<ul style="list-style-type:none;">
  <li>&rarr; [1a] You provide us "your <mark>Gmail</mark> address", "<mark>first name</mark>", and "<mark>last name</mark>".</li>
  <li>&larr; [1b] We will send you a *secure* Google Drive link for you to upload your tax documents.</li>
  <br>
  <li>&rarr; [2a] You upload your <mark>complete</mark> set of tax documents according to the <a href="/cat/tax/2024/12/31/tax-check-list.html" target="_blank">checklist</a> (<mark>this is a clickable link</mark>).</li>
  <li>&larr; [2b] We will let you know if we can do it, and if so we will provide a <mark>fixed</mark>, below-market price based on the number of reporting items and the organization of your documents, along with an estimated turnaround time.
                  Based on our experience, we cannot provide an estimated price until we have reviewed your documents.</li>
  <br>
  <li>&rarr; [3a] You tell us that you agree with the price.</li>
  <li>&larr; [3b] We will prepare your tax return and upload it to the same link for your verification.</li>
  <br>
  <li>&rarr; [4a] You tell us that you have verified the tax return and it is okay or you ask questions.</li>
  <li>&larr; [4b] We will send you a request for an electronic signature (or upload a signature document).</li>
  <br>
  <li>&rarr; [5a] You tell us that you have signed.</li>
  <li>&larr; [5b] We will electronically file your tax return (or file it on paper in rare cases).</li>
  <br>
  <li>&rarr; [6a] You pay us according to what we have agreed previously.</li>
  <li>&larr; [6b] We will acknowledge your payment.</li>
</ul>
