title: Communication Protocol for New Client
---

<html>
<body>

<p>
For <mark>new clients</mark>, we can prepare your return when time and circumstances allow (e.g. off-peak season, no complex issues), we will follow this
six-step communication protocol which has been tested by so many people over so many years.<br>
</p>

<ul style="list-style-type:none;">
  <li>&rarr; [1a] You provide us "your <mark>Gmail</mark> address", "<mark>first name</mark>", and "<mark>last name</mark>".</li>
  <li>&larr; [1b] We will send you a *secure* Google Drive link for you to upload your tax documents.</li>
  <br>
  <li>&rarr; [2a] You upload your last year returns, describe what is new in current and special situations to be handled. Alternatively, you upload your <mark>complete</mark> set of tax documents for the current year according to the <a href="/cat/tax/2025/12/31/tax-check-list.html" target="_blank">checklist</a> (<mark>this is a clickable link</mark>).</li>
  <li>&larr; [2b] We will let you know if we can do it, and if so we will provide an estimate.</li>
  <br>
  <li>&rarr; [3a] You tell us that you agree with the price.</li>
  <li>&larr; [3b] We will prepare your tax return and upload it to the same link for your verification.</li>
  <br>
  <li>&rarr; [4a] You tell us that you have verified the tax return and it is okay or you ask questions.</li>
  <li>&larr; [4b] We will send you a request for an electronic signature (or upload a signature document).</li>
  <br>
  <li>&rarr; [5a] You tell us that you have signed.</li>
  <li>&larr; [5b] We will electronically file your tax return (or file it on paper in rare cases).</li>
  <br>
  <li>&rarr; [6a] You pay us according to what we have agreed previously.</li>
  <li>&larr; [6b] We will acknowledge your payment.</li>
</ul>
