- [Q1] Can you guarantee data security and privacy?

Yes, we have a Google Workspace account for "advanced security", and we recommend that you use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-factor_authentication" target="_blank">Multi-factor authentication (MFA)</a> to protect your Gmail account. As an industry common practice, we will never reveal your information to anyone without your permission (except as required by the law which has never happened in our practice).

- [Q2] What are your and my responsibilities?

Like a software object with parameters and procedures, your return involves two type of components: the facts and original data that are your responsibility, the application of the law and computation of data, which are our responsibility.

- [Q3] If I am audited, can you help me?

Yes, definitely. Every return we file carries a lifetime guarantee which includes:

-- Error correction. If we made an error, we will restore your return to the state that we have done it correctly in the first place, at our expense. 

-- Audit representation. If it is our error and we cannot resolve the issue, we will refund your payment in full.

-- Loss recovery. If we have made an error that caused an irreversible economic loss, we will compensate you for the loss.

Fine prints: 

-- You must notify us of any errors within 3 years of filing. 

-- You must notify and provide us with the initial government notices within 60 days of issue.

- [Q4] How do you set your price?

We determine our price not based on forms alone, but holistically on what you have, and how well your documents are organized.

Statistically, our price is lower than the average market price, with most prices falling on one standard deviation below the mean, meaning that 84.13% of people charge more than us, while 15.87% charge less.

Here is an accidental, uninvited ["testimony"](/assets/images/20220207-price-of-conscience.jpeg){:target="_blank"} that happened in our possession in which a potential client inquires a returning client on our price, and both agreed that our price is a price of conscience. 

- [Q5] How can you keep the price below the market price?

There are two reasons. Firstly with your cooperation by following the well-established communication protocol and providing a complete and well-organized set of facts and tax documents, and secondly due to [economy of skill](/cat/prose/2020/12/24/economy-of-skill.html){:target="_blank"}.

- [Q6] Do you provide tax advice and planning?

Yes and no. We do not offer standalone tax advice and planning, our core business is to file personal tax returns, and included in the service we answer all questions related to your return, and on a best-effort basis answer all tax-related questions, up to the next filing season. Most people find that they are able to act on their own after having their questions thoroughly researched and answered.

- [Q7] Do you provide a referral bonus?

No, we do not offer anymore. Preparing tax returns is a time-consuming and labor-intensive job, and we need to focus on serving our existing clients well.
