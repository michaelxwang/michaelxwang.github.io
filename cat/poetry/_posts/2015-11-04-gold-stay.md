至美难存
麦克译

初绿为金
其色奇珍
新叶如花
失之转瞬
嫩叶枯萎 
伊甸沉沦
黎明破晓
至美难存

Nothing Gold Can Stay 
Robert Lee Frost (March 26, 1874 – January 29, 1963)

Nature's first green is gold, 
Her hardest hue to hold.
Her early leafs a flower; 
But only so an hour.  
Then leaf subsides to leaf. 
So Eden sank to grief,  
So dawn goes down to day.
Nothing gold can stay.
```
