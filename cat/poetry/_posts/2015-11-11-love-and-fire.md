李小龙《爱与火》
麦克译

爱如火焰
初时绚烂
虽热且烈
微光闪闪
爱至长久
心绪沉淀
燃烧于内
犹如煤炭

Love and fire 
Bruce Lee (November 27, 1940 - July 20, 1973)

Love is like a friendship caught on fire
In the beginning a flame very pretty
Often hot and fierce
But still only light and flickering.
As love grows older
Our hearts mature  
And our love becomes as coals
Deep-burning and unquenchable
```
