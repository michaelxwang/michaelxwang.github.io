- For qualified distributions, both contribution and earning are free from tax and penalty.
- Contribution (basis) can be withdrawn any time without tax and penalty regardless age and how long the account has been opened.
- Conversion more than 5 years is not subject to penalty.

- ordering rules (from [Pub 590-B page 32][590b]):
  - contribution.
  - conversion - taxable (at the time of conversion).
  - conversion - nontaxable (at the time of conversion).
  - earnings.

- 10% penalty exceptions (from [Pub 590-B page 32][590b]):

- Qualified distribution (from [Pub 590-B page 31][590b]):
  - account opened >= 5 years AND
  - age >= 59.5 OR disabled OR inherited OR first home up to 10,000.

- Five year rule: Account opened at least 5 years. Clock starts from January 1 of the year to which you allocate the contribution. Each rollover is accounted for separately.
- First home: did not buy a home within 2 years, up to 10,000 lifetime limit.

Examples:

In all the examples, the taxpayer is less than 59.5 years old.

Example (1):

- 2020: distribution 33000
- 2016: direct contribution 5000: tax:  no, penalty: no (is contribution, not conversion)
- 2017: direct contribution 5000: tax:  no, penalty: no (is contribution, not conversion)
- 2018: direct contribution 5000: tax:  no, penalty: no (is contribution, not conversion)

- earning: 13000                : tax: yes, penalty: yes (not qualified distribution)
- qualified first time home purchase: 10000 exception

Since the age of the ROTH IRA account is less than 5 years, so it is non-qualified distribution.
