title: "Tax notes: IRA excess contribution penalty"
categories:

---

Summary:

- The excess is subject to 6% exercise tax each year until distributed.
- The earnings are subject to tax as ordinary income "for the year
_in_ which the exess contribution was made." /* So, if you made an excess
contribution in 2023 before the tax due date, even if that contribution was allocated to
the 2022 tax year, any earnings from that excess contribution would
be reported on your 2023 tax return. The publication indicates
that the income should be reported in the year when it was
actually earned, which is the year when the excess contribution happened. */
- The earnings are also subject to 10% early distribution penalty before 59<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?\tiny\frac{1}{2}">. /* "Beginning on or after December 29, 2022, the 10% ad- ditional tax will not apply to your withdrawal of interest or other income, if withdrawn on or before the due date (including extensions) of the income tax return." */

Details:

- You have up to the due date (including extension) to withdraw excess contribution plus earnings.
- After filing your return, you can still withdraw within 6 months "pursuant to section 301.9100-2".
- If you have deducted the excess contribition, you need to amend the return not to deduct.
- Excess contribition can be absorbed by the allowed contribution limit next year.

Example:

- In 2019, Jack Ma (born September 10, 1964) made excess contribution 5000.
- In 2020, He made another excess contribution 6000.
- In 2021, In November, He withdrew 11,000 plus earnings 1,200.

Here are the consequences:

- In 2019, he will pay 5000 * 6% exercise tax.
- In 2020, he will pay (5000 + 6000) * 6% exercise tax.
- In 2021, he will pay regular tax and 10% early distribution penalty on 1200.
