The IRS
[website](https://www.irs.gov/credits-deductions/credits-for-new-electric-vehicles-purchased-in-2022-or-before)
says:

> The maximum credit is $7,500. It is nonrefundable, so you can't
get back more on the credit than you owe in taxes.

More than one client has asked me if they should reduce withholding
to make sure that they owe more than $7,500. No, it's not necessary.
What the IRS meant was that the credit can only be used to offset
your tax liability based on your income and applicable tax laws,
after taking into account any tax credits or deductions you are
eligible for, but before taking into account the tax withholding,
as shown below:

This prevents people from taking the credit for free. For example,
if someone has no income, they cannot take the credit at all. If
someone has $9,000 in taxable income and their tax liability is
$900, then they can only use the credit to offset the tax liability
to zero, and will lose the rest of the credit.
