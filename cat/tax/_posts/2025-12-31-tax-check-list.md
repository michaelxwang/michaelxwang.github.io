**Checklist ['tʃeklist]**: n. a list of items (names or tasks etc.) to be checked or consulted.

- You do not need to answer questions that are not applicable to you.
- You do not need to answer questions if already covered by tax documents.
- Please **highlight** information you do not want me to miss.
- Please do indicate your spreadsheet contains multiple tabs, example: check_list_info (multiple tabs).xls.
- Please try to avoid but do indicate when a file contains multiple facts, example: all_1099_forms (multiple docs).pdf.
- Please do not embed tax documents in the checklist info doc.

not change your state residency. For travel history outside the United States,
you can retrieve your records from the [I94 Website](https://i94.cbp.dhs.gov/I94/#/history-search){:target="_blank"}.

### Income and Income Adjustment.

- [W-2](https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/fw2.pdf) wage forms from ALL employers for the year.
- Retirement distribution. When dealing with pensions, annuities, distributions
  from retirement plans, rollovers, and conversions (including **"backdoor" Roth
  conversions**), you're essentially moving money between two accounts: the account
  the money is coming from (source) and the account the money is going to
  (target). I need the following 4 pieces of information. For each transaction, please organize the information into separate
  folders and include the following details:

  - Source of the Money: If possible, provide the information from Form 5498 for
    the source account, showing contributions. If you don't have this form, note
    the date you made the contribution, how much you contributed, and the year it
    was for, based on your records.
  - Amount Withdrawn: Provide information on distributions made in 2025 from
    the source account, using Form 1099-R issued for the year.
  - Remaining Balance in the Source Account(s): Indicate the year-end balance in
    the source account(s), either from Form 5498 or your records. If you have multiple
    traditional or rollover IRA accounts, it is the **COMBINED** balance. For tax theory, see 
    [Backdoor Roth IRA](https://taxandlife.com/cat/tax/2019/12/22/roth-back-door.html){:target="_blank"}.
  - Destination of the Money: If you have Form 5498 for the target account,
    include it to show rollovers or conversions. If not, specify the type of
    account the money was moved to (IRA, Roth IRA, 401K, Roth 401K, etc.), along
    with the amount received in 2025, based on your records.

  For example:

  - Contribution: I added $7,000 to a traditional IRA on April 1, 2025, for the 2025 tax year. I don't have Form 5498 from the source right now (usually issued in May).
  - Distribution: I moved $7,000 from the traditional IRA, as detailed on Form 1099-R.
  - Remaining Balance: As of December 31, 2025, the **combined** balance of **all** my traditional and rollover IRAs across **all** banks was $6, but I do not have Forms 5498 to show this.
  - Destination: The $7,000 was transferred to a Roth IRA in 2025, but I don't have Form 5498 for the target account.

  NB: A Rollover IRA is a type of Traditional IRA that is specifically used to hold money rolled over from an employer-sponsored retirement plan (like a 401(k), 403(b), or pension plan).

  - The date that you contributed or you will contribute (you have until the filing deadline to make contribution).

The IRS allows for a tax exclusion of up to $250,000 ($500,000 for
married couples filing jointly) of capital gains from the sale of
a primary residence under certain conditions as specified in [IRC 121](https://www.taxnotes.com/research/federal/usc26/121){:target="_blank"}.

The conditions are:

- The property must be the taxpayer's main home and owned by the
taxpayer for at least two of the five years preceding the sale.
- The exclusion can only be claimed once every two years.

It's important to note that this exclusion may have limits or not apply
in certain situations, such as if the home was used as a rental
property, if the taxpayer was involved in a 1031 exchange.

If you qualify for the exclusion, and the capital gain is clearly within the limit, then you do not need to submit
the list of improvements and expenses related to the sale.

### HSA.

If you have HSA (Health Savings Account), please provide:

- Is it a "self-only" plan (insurance only covers yourself) or a family plan? i.e. does the insurance cover only yourself or a family member as well?
- [1099-SA](https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/f1099sa.pdf) or the amount spent from HSA. Zero is also a meaningful number.
- All the spending from the HSA was used for medical purposes and not reimbursed.
- The amount you contributed yourself by depositing a check or making a bank transfer. The contribution via payroll is already excluded from taxable income in W-2.
- [5498-SA](https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/f5498sa.pdf) if you have it (optional).
- [CA and NJ] They tax HSA investment earnings. Your HSA provider does NOT issue a 1099 for these amounts, so you must provide them from your year-end HSA statement. Please upload a separate file named "HSA_earnings_state_taxable" containing the following information:
  - Total interest earned in year:
  - Total dividends received (including reinvested):
  - Total realized capital gains or losses (from selling investments, use negative number for losses):

### Homeowner and Itemizing Items

Provide the information when:

- You have a large home mortgage payment (more than the standard deduction minus 10,000), or
- You live in a state which allows state itemized deduction while using the federal standard deduction

  The states that allow separate state itemized deduction:

  - CA  
  - DE  
  - NY

  The states that do not allow separate state itemized deduction:

  - MD  
  - VA

Generally, you itemize expenses if you own a home, or have large
deductible items such as donations, medical expenses, and state tax paid.

| Married Filing Jointly & Surviving Spouse | $31,500 |

    by adding the outstanding balance of a debt on each month during the
    taxable year that the debt is secured by a qualified residence, and dividing
    the sum by the number of months during the taxable year that the residence is a

- Where: Major brokers/banks that support Trump accounts (e.g., Fidelity, Schwab, others - check each firm’s implementation starting mid‑2026).
- What it invests in: Only very low‑cost U.S. stock index mutual funds/ETFs, no sector bets or leverage.
- Why open one: To capture the $1,000 federal seed (if eligible) and long‑term tax‑deferred equity growth for a child, with relatively simple, low‑fee investing.

Fun trivia: Form 4547 echoes that Trump is the 45th and 47th president. My tax software does not support the form as of now.

### Foreign Earned Income Exclusion (FEIE) / Foreign Tax Credit (FTC)

You can qualify Foreign Earned Income Exclusion by passing either:

- Bona Fide Residence Test: To qualify, you must have established a residence
  in a foreign country and lived there for an uninterrupted period that
  includes an entire tax year (January 1 to December 31). You need to demonstrate
  an intention to stay in the foreign country indefinitely or for an extended
  period, integrating into the local community and lifestyle. Paying local taxes
  may help support your claim, but it is not a strict requirement.

- Physical Presence Test: You must be physically present in a foreign country
  or countries for at least 330 full days during any consecutive 12-month
  period. This 12-month period does not need to be entirely within the current
  year, but it must include part of the current year to claim the exclusion for
  that year. This test qualifies you for a prorated exclusion limit based on the number
  of qualifying days in the year.

Additionally, you can generally claim the Foreign Tax Credit for foreign taxes
paid on income included in your U.S. tax return that is not excluded under the
Foreign Earned Income Exclusion.

- A _Resident_ Received a Gift From a Nonresident

When a citizen or resident alien receives a gift<sup>[1](#fn1)</sup> exceeding $100,000 from _a
nonresident alien_ or from a group of related nonresident aliens, they are
required to file [Form 3520][form 3520]{:target="_blank"}.
However, no tax is due on this gift.

The limit applies individually to each recipient, not to a husband and wife
collectively. For example, if a husband receives $90,000 and a wife receives
$110,000, only the wife is required to file the form, as her amount exceeds the
specified limit.

If you meet the filing requirement, please compile a list of gifts received,
including dates, descriptions of the gift, amounts. Please organize a separate table
for each recipient, listing all entries in chronological order. Example:

| Date       | Recipient   | Description            | Amount      |
| ---------- | ----------- | ---------------------- | -----------:|
| 04/15/2025 | Xiaohua Mao | Cash                   |   $80,000   |
| 10/15/2025 | Xiaohua Mao | Cash                   |   $80,000   |
| **Total**  |             |                        | **$160,000**|

<a name="fn1">1</a> According to the IRS, a gift is defined as:

> Any transfer to an individual, either directly or indirectly, where full
> consideration (measured in money or money's worth) is not received in return.

If the transaction is not a gift but rather a loan or a movement of your
personal funds, then there's no need to file [Form 3520][form 3520]{:target="_blank"}.
However, it's essential to maintain a detailed record
of the funds' source and their intended use in case of inquiries from the
["big brother"][big brother]{:target="_blank"}.

- A _Resident_ Given a Gift

If you give a gift of more than the annual exclusion limit of $18,000 (2025),
you must file [Form 709][form 709]{:target="_blank"}. However, you do
not have to pay gift tax unless your lifetime gifts exceed the lifetime gift
tax limit of $13.61 million (2025). This is the total amount of money or
property that you can give away during your lifetime without having to pay gift
tax.

Please provide:

- Last filed form 709.
- Donee’s name.
- Donne's address.
- Relationship to the donor (if any).
- Description of gift.
- If the gift was of securities, give CUSIP no.
- If a closely held entity, give EIN.

I hope this checklist helps you to prepare your tax documents.
