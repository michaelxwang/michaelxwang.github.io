Under the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tax_Cuts_and_Jobs_Act_of_2017" target="_blank">Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017</a>, taxpayers can
only deduct interest paid on up to $750,000 of mortgage debt, down
from the previous limit of $1 million.

The deduction limit for mortgage interest applies on a per-family
basis. That means if you are single, you can deduct the mortgage
interest on up to $750,000 of mortgage debt. If you file jointly,
you do not get double the amount, as it is still $750,000. For those
who file their taxes separately and are married, the limit is
$375,000 for each spouse.

For unmarried co-owners, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals has reversed a previous decison
of the Tax Court, and <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=18277798258129653206" target="blank">ruled</a> that "<a
href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/163" target="_blank">§
163(h)(3)</a>'s debt limits apply to unmarried co-owners on a
per-taxpayer basis". That is, each unmarried co-owner can claim a mortgage interest
deduction on up to $750,000 of mortgage debt. The case originated
from California, where homes are expensive, but with the IRS's <a

target="blank">acquiescence</a> (their reluctant acceptance without
protest), the decision applies to every state. Please note both of the court's decision and the IRS's acquiescence
refer to the old limit, but the principle applies to the new limit.

Regarding how to divide the mortgage interest between two unmarried co-owners, the IRS has two rules: you had an obligation to pay, and you paid.
In my opinion, if we can agree on the distribution of wealth and debt, we don't need to involve the government or lawyers.

This particular tax rule may seem to discourage marriage, but don't let the IRS dictate your love life. Instead, take inspiration from the Hungarian poet Sándor Petőfi, who wrote:

Tax is truly steep  
Priceless is the heart   
For the sake of love  
Wealth can be set 'part

This poem serves as a poignant reminder that the value of love surpasses all riches, and we should be unafraid to devote ourselves to it.
