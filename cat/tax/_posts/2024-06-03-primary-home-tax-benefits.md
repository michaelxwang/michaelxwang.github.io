Tax deductions and credits for a primary residence are more limited compared to those available for rental properties.
For rental properties, expenses such as maintenance, repairs, property
management fees, mortgage interest, and other operational costs are generally
deductible against rental income. 
This article explores the tax deductions and credits available for owning a primary residence.

#### Property tax deduction

A combined deduction limit of $10,000 applies to real estate taxes, state income taxes, and local
taxes. It is set to expire in 2026 tax year due to the Tax
Cuts and Jobs Act unless extended or modified by future legislation.

If you have low mortgage interest, you are generally better off taking the standard deduction.
For 2023 tax year, the standard deduction is $27,700 for married couples filing jointly, $13,850 for single filers, and $20,800 for heads of household
These amounts are adjusted annually for inflation.

#### Mortgage interest deduction

The mortgage interest deduction applies to interest paid on mortgage debt up to
$750,000. This limit is scheduled to change after 2025 tax year.

If you do not have mortgage interest or other significant itemized deductions,
it may be more beneficial to take the standard deduction.

#### [Primary Home Capital Gain Exclusion][121 exclusion]{:target="_blank"}

For married couples filing jointly, up to $500,000 of capital gains can be
excluded. For single filers and married individuals filing separately, up to
$250,000 of capital gains can be excluded.

You must have owned and used the property as your primary residence for at least 2 of the 5 years before the sale.

Home improvement expenses (as opposed to repair expenses) can be used to reduce
the capital gain if your profit exceeds the exclusion limit when you sell your home.
They are not deductible in current year.
