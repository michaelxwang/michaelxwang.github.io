title: Bank's Form W-8BEN request
categories:

---

Banks and other financial institutions are required by the IRS to collect
certain tax documents from account holders, based on their residency status.

If your bank's records show you as a nonresident alien, they will ask you to
complete [Form W-8BEN][W-8BEN]{:target="_blank"} to comply with these regulations.
If you are a nonresident alien, you should fill out the form as requested.
The IRS [Form W-8BEN][W-8BEN]{:target="_blank"}, Certificate of Foreign Status of Beneficial Owner for
United States Tax Withholding and Reporting (Individuals), is used by
nonresident aliens to certify their foreign status, claim tax treaty benefits,
and report income not effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or
business in the U.S.

However, if you are actually a resident alien for tax purposes, the bank's
records might not be up to date or they might be missing some key information
about your tax status. You should instead complete IRS [Form W-9][W-9]{:target="_blank"},
Request for Taxpayer Identification Number and Certification. This form
provides your bank with your Social Security Number or Individual Taxpayer
Identification Number and confirms that you're not subject to backup
withholding.

If you're unsure about your status or how to proceed,
consider consulting a tax professional or attorney. They can provide advice
tailored to your specific situation.
