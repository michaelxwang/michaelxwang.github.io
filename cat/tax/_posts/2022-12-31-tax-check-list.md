### Sale of a primary home

The IRS allows for a tax exclusion of up to $250,000 ($500,000 for
married couples filing jointly) of capital gains from the sale of
a primary residence under certain conditions as specified in IRC 121.

The conditions are:

- The property must be the taxpayer's main home and owned by the
taxpayer for at least two of the five years preceding the sale.
- The exclusion can only be claimed once every two years.

It's important to note that this exclusion may have limits or not apply
in certain situations, such as if the home was used as a rental
property, if the taxpayer was involved in a 1031 exchange.

The following documents are needed to give us the rough estimate of the capital gain:

- [1099-S](https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/f1099s.pdf) if issued.
- Both [Closing documents][closing doc] when you bought and sold the property.

If is over the exclusion amount, then we will need the major improvements (that increase the home value) done during the years
to bring down the capital gain. 

### Homeowner and itemizing items

Provide the information when:

- You have a large home mortgage payment (more than the standard deduction minus 10,000), or

### A _Resident_ Received a Gift From a Nonresident

When a citizen or resident alien receives a gift<sup>[1](#fn1)</sup> exceeding $100,000 from _a
nonresident alien_ or from a group of related nonresident aliens, they are
required to file [Form 3520][form 3520]{:target="_blank"}.
However, no tax is due on this gift.

If you are the resident, please provide a list of dates and amounts of gifts. For example:

| Date       | Description            | Amount      |
| ---------- | ---------------------- | -----------:|
| 12/24/2022 | Cash from Santa Claus  |   $80,000   |
| 12/25/2022 | Cash from Mrs. Claus   |   $80,000   |
| **Total**  |                        | **$160,000**|

<a name="fn1">1</a> According to the IRS, a gift is defined as:

> Any transfer to an individual, either directly or indirectly, where full
> consideration (measured in money or money's worth) is not received in return.

If the transaction is not a gift but rather a loan or a movement of your
personal funds, then there's no need to file [Form 3520][form 3520]{:target="_blank"}.
However, it's essential to maintain a detailed record
of the funds' source and their intended use in case of inquiries from the
["big brother"][big brother]{:target="_blank"}.

If you give a gift of more than the annual exclusion limit of $17,000 (2023),
you must file [Form 709][form 709]{:target="_blank"}. However, you do
not have to pay gift tax unless your lifetime gifts exceed the lifetime gift
tax limit of $12.92 million (2023). This is the total amount of money or
property that you can give away during your lifetime without having to pay gift
tax.

Please provide:

- Last filed form 709.
- Donee‚Äôs name.
- Donne's address.
- Relationship to the donor (if any).
- Description of gift.
