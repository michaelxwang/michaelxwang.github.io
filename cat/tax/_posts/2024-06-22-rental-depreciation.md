Depreciation refers to the process of writing off the cost of a property over
time due to its usage and wear and tear. This concept implies that as property
is used, it loses value, and this loss needs to be accounted for (deducted)
over time. This thinking is reflected in rental home depreciation. Notably,
land is not depreciated as it is timeless, and the base for depreciation is the
lesser of the cost basis or the fair market value (FMV) as you cannot lose what
you currently have. For the purpose of this discussion, we assume, without losing generality, the FMV is
higher than the cost basis, which is commonly the case.

Even if the value of the rental property does not decrease, the
IRS allows for depreciation to recover the cost of the property over time through tax deductions. For
rental properties in the United States, the depreciation period is set at 27.5 years according to [IRC Section 168(c)][irc-168]{:target="_blank"}.
Depreciation reduces the cost basis of the property as it has been used to offset the rental income,
if the value of the property is greater than the adjusted cost basis when the property is sold, the depreciation is partially or fully
recaptured.

In standard rental situations, depreciation starts when the property is ready
for rent and stops when it is sold, converted to personal use, or after the
27.5-year period. However, complexities arise when a rental property switches
between business use and personal use, or when the business use percentage
changes.

#### Discontinued Periods of Rental Use

Consider a scenario where a rental home is rented for about 4 years, then
converted to personal use for about 2 years, and then rented again starting
07/04/2024. Here's an example of such a situation:

| Start      | End        | Months | Basis     | Depreciated | Accumulated |
|-----------:|-----------:|-------:|----------:|------------:|------------:|
| <span style="color:blue">06/19/2018</span> | 12/31/2018 |  6.50  | 600,000   | 11818       | 11818       |
| 01/01/2019 | 12/31/2019 | 12.00  | 600,000   | 21818       | 33636       |
| 01/01/2020 | 12/31/2020 | 12.00  | 600,000   | 21818       | 55454       |
| 01/01/2021 | 12/31/2021 | 12.00  | 600,000   | 21818       | 77272       |
| 01/01/2022 | <span style="color:blue">05/20/2022</span> |  4.50  | <span style="color:red">600,000</span>   |  8182       | <span style="color:red">85454</span>       |
| 01/01/2023 | 12/31/2023 | 12.00  | not rented|     0       | 85454       |
| <span style="color:red">07/04/2024</span>| 12/31/2024 | 12.00  | <span style="color:red">514,546</span>  |  8576       | 94030       |

In this scenario, you cannot simply resume the original depreciation schedule.

- Continuing with the original depreciation starting date and basis would
depreciate the property during the personal use period.
- Changing the depreciation starting date to July 4, 2024, without adjusting the cost basis,
would allow full depreciation again on top of what has already been deducted.

I recommend starting a new depreciation schedule when a rental property
experiences a significant change in use, such as a period of personal use.

- This new schedule would begin on July 4, 2024.
- The cost basis for the new schedule would be the original cost basis minus the accumulated depreciation from the previous schedule.
- This accumulated depreciation should be tracked. When selling the property, you can use this information to calculate capital gains.

The benefits of this approach include:

- It allows the cost basis to be fully and correctly depreciated. While you technically get another 27.5 years of depreciation, the total amount of depreciation won't exceed the original cost basis.
The extended depreciation period benefits the IRS and avoids potential issues with them. It's a reasonable approach since you're essentially starting a new rental period.
- It simplifies record-keeping as you only need the current schedule to calculate the capital gain when then rental is sold.

#### Rental Property with Varied Business Use Percentages

Now, let's explore situations where the business use percentage of a property changes:

- Increased Business Use:

  - You can continue the existing depreciation schedule for the original portion of the property.
  - Additionally, you can create a new depreciation schedule for the increased business use percentage, with a new starting date and a cost basis reflecting the increased portion's value.
  - Alternatively, you can stop the current depreciation, and start a new schedule in the similar manner as in "Discontinued Periods of Rental Use".

- Decreased Business Use:

  Since adding a negative depreciation schedule isn't allowed, the recommended approach is to start a new depreciation schedule with:
  - A new starting date reflecting the change in use.
  - A new cost basis reflecting the original basis minus the accumulated depreciation from the previous schedule.

#### Conclusion:

Depreciation calculations can become complex when dealing with rental
properties with varied use in time and space. My recommended method benefits the taxpayers
while staying compliant with the IRS guidelines, and is easy to maintain.
