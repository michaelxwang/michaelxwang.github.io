Married couples often ask whether they should file taxes separately or
jointly. This post explains the mechanics behind the decision.

Generally, the tax brackets for joint filers are wider - often exactly
double - those for separate filers. Taking the [tax rate table][table]{:target="_blank"}
for 2022 as an example, the 10% bracket for
single or separate filers is $0 – $10,275, whereas for joint filers, it is $0 – $20,550.
However, this "doubling" rule no longer holds in the highest income
brackets (35% and above).

Ultimately, whether filing jointly lowers your taxes depends on "income shifting" - specifically,
whether the higher-earning spouse can shift income into
the lower-earning spouse's unused lower tax brackets.

The diagram below provides an intuitive illustration.

To summarize, we can look at three common scenarios:

- *Similar Incomes*: If both spouses earn roughly the same amount, the results
of filing separately versus jointly are usually comparable. The combined income
simply fills the doubled tax brackets, so the total tax is often similar.

- *Significant Income Disparity*: If one spouse has no income or significantly
lower income, the higher-earning spouse can use the unfilled lower tax
brackets (the empty "stairs") of the lower-earning spouse. This "averaging"
effect reduces the couple's overall tax liability.

  Note: This benefit disappears if both spouses are high earners who have already
reached the top tax bracket, because neither spouse has any "room" left on the lower
stairs to share.

- *Foreign Earned Income*: If one spouse utilizes the Foreign Earned Income
Exclusion, the outcome depends on the net effect of two competing factors.

  - The "Push Up" Effect: Under the "stacking rule," even though foreign income
  is excluded from tax, it still "occupies" the lower tax stairs. This pushes
  the other spouse's income higher up the stack, potentially into a higher tax
  bracket than if they filed separately.

  - The "Income Shifting" Effect: Conversely, filing jointly still provides the
  standard benefit of wider brackets and a larger standard deduction, which can
  help absorb taxable income.

  - The Net Result: Whether filing jointly lowers your liability in this scenario
  is not automatic; it depends entirely on which factor is stronger - the penalty
  from being pushed into higher brackets or the savings from income shifting.

Beyond the simple bracket‑filling picture, here are several special cases:

- Nonresident alien spouse.

  Generally, if both spouses are nonresident aliens for the tax year, they are
  barred from filing jointly. However, if at least one spouse is a U.S. citizen
  or resident (holding a Green Card or meeting the [substantial presence test][substantial]{:target="_blank"})
  on the last day of the year, the couple
  can make a special election to treat the nonresident spouse as a U.S. resident
  for tax purposes.

  The Trade-off: Deciding to make this election requires weighing two competing factors.

  - *The Benefit (Income Shifting & Deductions)*: Filing jointly unlocks the higher
  Standard Deduction (which nonresidents typically cannot claim) and allows for
  income shifting through wider tax brackets.

  - *The Cost (Worldwide Income Inclusion)*: In exchange, the nonresident spouse is
  required to report their entire worldwide income to the IRS—income that would
  otherwise be outside the U.S. tax net if they filed a separate nonresident
  return. However, the actual tax liability on this foreign income can often be
  partially or fully offset by utilizing the Foreign Earned Income Exclusion or
  the Foreign Tax Credit.

  *The Commitment*: This election effectively subjects the couple to "worldwide
  taxation" and remains in effect for all future years until terminated. However,
  you should proceed with caution: if you ever choose to revoke this election,
  you generally cannot make it again. Because the decision to end the election is
  final and prohibits you from re-electing in the future, the initial decision
  should be made with great care. Please refer to [this post][implication]{:target="_blank"} for further details.

- California mental health services tax.

  California imposes an additional 1% Mental Health Services Tax on taxable
income exceeding $1 million, regardless of whether a taxpayer files jointly or
separately.

  However, because California is a community property state, couples with a
significant income disparity can sometimes benefit by electing to file separately.
This allows them to split their community income between two separate returns.
In an ideal scenario, the lower-earning spouse can "absorb" up to $1 million of
the allocated income, potentially saving the family up to $10,000 in state
taxes.

- Liability protection and non‑tax issues.

  Finally, if one spouse owes past-due child support or faces other complex
liabilities, the other spouse may need to file separately to insulate themselves from
that debt. Filing jointly makes both parties jointly and severally liable,
meaning both are responsible for the obligation regardless of who incurred it.
In such cases, the decision is a matter of legal protection rather than
tax calculation.

As the saying goes, "the devil is in the details." While this article aims to
clarify the core logic, actual tax situations are often much more complex. Many
tax credits and deductions are tied to specific filing statuses and income
levels, so there is no simple formula or "analytic solution" that applies
to everyone.

If the answer isn't immediately obvious, theory only goes so far - it is always
better to run the actual numbers. As an integral part of the return preparation
process, I can generate a side-by-side comparison report (Joint vs. Separate).
If the calculations show that filing separately is more advantageous, we will
switch your filing status to ensure the best financial outcome.
