title: Other Taxes or Should I Call It High-Income Taxes?

Ah, the U.S. tax system: a labyrinth that keeps tax professionals in business
and the rest perpetually confused. Today, let’s dive into two delightfully
ambiguous topics from your tax return — **"Other Taxes"** (Line 23 on the 2024
Form 1040) and **Payments on "Other Forms"** (Line 25c on the 2024 Form 1040).

"Other Taxes" sounds suspiciously like the IRS ran out of naming creativity.
This line is reserved for those who, shall we say, find themselves on the nicer
side of the income curve. If I were the IRS, I’d call it bluntly: **the High-Income
Taxes**. As the Spaniards would say, "call bread bread and wine
wine" (*llamar al pan, pan y al vino, vino*).

Here’s a quick breakdown of what might land here:

- The Additional Medicare Tax (Form 8959)

For high earners (over $200,000 for singles or $250,000 for couples), you get a
special **0.9% tax** on Medicare wages above those thresholds. Please note this tax
only applies to wages above those thresholds, not total income, and it applies to wages,
self employment income, and railroad retirement only. What’s
better than being successful? Being taxed more for it! Let’s verify the math in
the diagram:

$$
( \$584,431 - \$200,000 ) \times 0.9\% = \$3,460
$$

- Net Investment Income Tax (Form 8960)

Do you have income from interest, dividends, capital gains, or rental properties? If your
Modified Adjusted Gross Income (MAGI) exceeds $200,000 ($250,000 for joint
filers), the IRS wants a **3.8% cut** on the investment income. In the example:

$$
\$31,415 \times 3.8\% = \$1,194
$$

When you add the two amounts:

$$
\$3,460 + \$1,194 = \$4,654
$$

This matches the **"Other Taxes"** total on Line 23 of Form 1040.

Now for Payments on "Other Forms" (Line 25c). This line represents credits or
taxes you’ve already paid elsewhere. A common example is your employer might have
withheld the additional 0.9% Medicare tax on your wages. See? Your employer is
already playing nice with Uncle Sam. However, since your employer only knows
the income they pay you, not income from other sources, the extra withholding
is often less than what you owe. This is especially true if you have multiple
jobs.

The credit is calculated in **Part V** of Form 8959 by subtracting the regular Medicare tax at 1.45% from the actual Medicare tax withheld. Let’s verify it in this example:

$$
\$9,203 - (\$584,431 \times 1.45\%) = \$729
$$

While extra withholding is the most common example, the payment could also be from
the amount withheld for the net investment income tax. 

While "Other Taxes" gets all the attention because it *takes* from you, Line
25c often gets ignored because it *gives back*. Funny how nobody writes to
me saying, “Hey, I think I got too much credit on Line 25c.
Should we fix that?” From this observation, I derived a universal truth: **tax is bad, credit is good**.

The taxes on **Form 8959** (Additional Medicare Tax) and **Form 8960** (Net
Investment Income Tax) were introduced as part of the **Affordable Care Act
(ACA)**, commonly known as Obamacare. Their purpose is to help fund Medicare
and health care-related provisions under the ACA. I hope you feel better knowing
that this part of your taxes contributes to the social good, allowing many people
to obtain health insurance through Obamacare who would otherwise could not afford.
