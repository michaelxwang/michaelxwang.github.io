title: Nonresident Alien and Economic Impact Payment Round 3
categories:
- tax
---

Many people who filed as a nonresident alien on Form 1040-NR have received
a check of $1,400 (nonresident aliens cannot file a joint return and cannot claim
dependents except certain nationalities). This is an error by the IRS.

Economic Impact Payment 3 was authorized by [American Rescue Plan Act of 2021][arpa] which added [Internal Revenue Code (IRC) Section 6428B][irc]. 
The [IRC Section 6428B(c)][irc] defined the eligibal individual as follows:

<blockquote style="margin-left: 0px;">
  (c) <b>Eligible individual.</b> For purposes of this section, the term "eligible individual" means any individual other than -<br>
    <span style="display: inline-block; margin-left: 20px;">(1) any nonresident alien individual,</span><br>
    <span style="display: inline-block; margin-left: 20px;">(2) any individual who is a dependent of another taxpayer for a taxable year beginning in the calendar year in which the individual's taxable year begins, and</span><br>
    <span style="display: inline-block; margin-left: 20px;">(3) an estate or trust.</span>
</blockquote>

The IRS interpreted the law accordingly in its [FAQ][faq]:

> **Did I qualify for the third payment if I'm a resident alien? (Updated March 25, 2022)**
>
> A person who’s a qualifying resident alien with a valid Social Security number
> was eligible for the payment only if he or she is a qualifying resident alien
> in 2021 and not claimed as a dependent of another taxpayer. A nonresident alien
> in 2021 wasn’t eligible for the payment. An alien who received a payment but
> was not a qualifying resident alien for 2021 should return the payment to the
> IRS by following the instructions as described in Returning the Economic Impact
> Payment for instructions.

The IRS is an executive branch of the US government, it can make a mistake in its execution, but it cannot change the
the law. When the IRS sent you the check, it accompanies with a letter asking to agree or not agree, you should not
agree, and following the [instructions][sendback] to send the check back to the IRS.
