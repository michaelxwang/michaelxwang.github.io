If you happen to feel a little guilty about eating too much food, here’s a fun math problem to help you forget the guilt:

>At the Thanksgiving family gathering, there are 12 people and 12 seats. The
>host has assigned each seat to a specific guest by writing their name on it.
>However, the great-uncle arrived first and, in a confused manner, randomly
>chose a seat to sit in. Subsequent guests look for their assigned seat first.
>If their assigned seat is empty, they sit there; if it is already occupied,
>they randomly choose another seat. The host sits last. What is the probability
>that the host ends up sitting in their own assigned seat?

This problem seems rather complicated at first glance. Suppose the great-uncle
took X's seat; then the choices for X and the remaining guests differ, and
there are endless possibilities when X arrives. You might argue that the people
who come before X do not matter, as they took their own seats as if they were
never invited. However, since the great-uncle was already in a confused state,
further argument would confuse him more.

Let us convert this calculation problem into a proof problem: the probability
that the host ends up sitting in their own assigned seat is \( \frac{1}{2} \).
To prove this, we use [Complete (Strong) Induction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_induction):

- Verify the base case ($$n=n_0$$).
- Assume the statement is true for all previous cases ($$n=k,k−1,k−2,…,n_0+1$$).
- Use this stronger assumption to prove the statement is true for $$n = k + 1$$.

#### Base Case ($$n = 3$$)

Suppose there are 3 seats: one for the great-uncle, one for the host, and one
for guest X. The great-uncle has three possible outcomes, tabulated
below:

The great-uncle has three outcomes as tabulated below along with the possibilities for each choice:

| outcome                | possibility of the outcome | possibilitry of the host taking his own seat |
|:----------------------|------:|------:|
| Take host seat        | $$1\over3$$   |0|
| Take his own seat     | $$1\over3$$   |1|
| Take guest X's seat   | $$1\over3$$   |$$1\over2$$|

According to the [Law of Total Probability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_total_probability), the total possibility of the host seating in his own seat is therefore:

$${1\over3}\times0 + {1\over3}\times1 + {1\over3}\times{1\over2} = {1\over2}$$

Thus, the base case holds.

#### Inductive Step ($$n = k + 1$$)

Now suppose there are $$n=k+1$$ seats: one for the great-uncle, one for the host, and $$n-2$$ for the remaining guests. The great-uncle’s possible outcomes are:

| outcome                | possibility of the outcome | possibilitry of the host taking his own seat |
|:----------------------|------:|------:|
| Take host seat        | $$1\over k+1$$   |0|
| Take his own sear     | $$1\over k+1$$   |1|
| Take any of the guests' seat    | $$k-1\over k+1$$   |$$1\over2$$|

When the great-uncle takes a guest’s seat, the confusion propagates. Before the displaced guest arrives, the other guests simply take their own seats and it does not affect the outcome. When the displaced guest does arrive, he
becomes the new "confused great-uncle", treating the great-uncle’s seat as his own, This reduces the problem to $$i$$ seats where $$i=k,k−1,k−2,…,3$$.

Assuming the possibilitry of the host taking his own seat is $$P(i) = {1\over2}$$, the total possibility $$P(k+1)$$ is:

$$
\begin{align*}
P(k+1) &= {1\over k+1}\times0 + {1\over k+1}\times1 + {k-1\over k+1}\times P(i) \\
       &= {1\over k+1} + {k-1\over k+1}\times{1\over2} \\
       &= {1\over2}
\end{align*}
$$

Thus, the statement holds for $$n = k + 1$$.

### Conclusion

By complete induction, the probability that the host sits in their own assigned seat is $$\frac{1}{2}$$ for any number of seats $$n \geq 2$$.
