The term 'Economy of Skill' is an original concept that I conceived
when I noticed an intriguing statistic: more experienced tax preparers
tend to charge less for certain forms than novices do. This initially
surprised me. However, I came to understand that those who are
proficient do not find these tasks challenging and, therefore,
typically charge a lower fee for what they perceive as straightforward
work. In contrast, those with less expertise often find these tasks
difficult and feel justified in charging a higher fee.

A Google search confirmed that this term was non-existent before I
first introduced it in a WeChat post on December 24, 2020. This
note serves as a record for the protection of intellectual property
rights associated with this concept.
