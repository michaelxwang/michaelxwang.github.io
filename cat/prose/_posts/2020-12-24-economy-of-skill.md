"Economy of skill" is a terminology that I invented when I see in a statistics that an more experienced tax preparer charges less on certain forms than a novice.
I was surprised at first, but later realized that those who are proficient will not find a task difficult and hence tend to charge a lower fee for what appears to be an easy job to her,
while those who lack skills or knowledge will struggle and find it justified to charge a higher fee.

Google search this term did not exist before I fist published in Wechat moment on 12/24/2020. This note is for intellectual property protection.
