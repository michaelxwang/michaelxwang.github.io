<p>
I have uploaded a "*_SIGN PDF file for you to sign, you can use one of the following alternative ways to sign.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Print the form, sign and <mark>date</mark>, scan, and upload the image.</li>
  <li>Sign the PDF file on Apple computer following <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/how-to/digitally-sign-a-pdf-using-preview-on-mac/" target="_blank">this instruction</a>.
  <li>Sign the PDF file on Windows computer following <a href="https://helpx.adobe.com/reader/using/fill-and-sign.html" target="_blank">this instruction</a>.
</ul>

<p>There are two common ways to create a signature:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Traditional <mark>Handwritten</mark> Signature: Create your signature by hand using a pen on a physical medium such as a piece of paper.</li>
    <li>Digital <mark>Handwritten</mark> Signature: Use a computer input device, such as a stylus or a mouse, to <mark>hand-draw</mark> your signature on a digital platform or application.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Please rename the file to <mark>*_SIGNED</mark> when you upload.
