I"Ò<p>The tax history project has compiled
an archive of <a href="http://www.taxhistory.org/www/website.nsf/Web/PresidentialTaxReturns">the presidential tax returns</a>,
in which we have the tax returns of Pence family from 2006 to 2015. By
going through these returns, we can see his family financial situation,
and the changes they had gone through these 10 years. All the information
contained in this analysis comes from the tax returns except otherwise
noted.</p>
