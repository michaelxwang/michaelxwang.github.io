I"^<p>朗费罗《箭与歌》<br />
麦克译</p>

<p>矢入云兮<br />
落地无痕<br />
逝之疾兮<br />
其踪难寻</p>

<p>歌入云兮<br />
落地无痕<br />
目不力兮<br />
余音难闻</p>

<p>况日经年<br />
矢现橡林<br />
歌亦安在<br />
藏于知音</p>

<p>The Arrow and the Song<br />
Henry Wadsworth Longfellow (1807 - 1882)</p>

<p>I shot an arrow into the air,<br />
It fell to earth, I knew not where;<br />
For, so swiftly it flew, the sight<br />
Could not follow it in its flight.</p>

<p>I breathed a song into the air,<br />
It fell to earth, I knew not where;<br />
For who has sight so keen and strong,<br />
That it can follow the flight of song?</p>

<p>Long, long afterward, in an oak<br />
I found the arrow, still unbroke;<br />
And the song, from beginning to end,<br />
I found again in the heart of a friend.</p>
