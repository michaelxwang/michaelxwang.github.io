I"x<p>RSUâ€™s (Restrict Stock Units) are the company stocks given to you usually for free,
however upon receiving the shares vested, you have to pay tax based on the fair market value of
the stocks as compensation (federal, state, and FICA taxes). There are two ways you can pay:
sell some stocks (sell to cover which is  default) or you come out with cash from your pocket.</p>
