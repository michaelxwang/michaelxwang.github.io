I"½<p>Over the years I have been amazed by the amount of math used in tax
laws, and some of them are complicated math. We have been talking about
depreciation for years, and we know there are percentage applied each
corresponding to the life of the property, and other variables, but have
you seen a literature where the actual percentages are derived? I have
not, and the purpose of this article is to derive math formulas used in
IRS tables.</p>
