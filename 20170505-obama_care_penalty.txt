Should I pay Obama care penalty

"I do not have insurance coverage,
should I pay penalty?" Many people
asked. The answer is most likely NO.

Trump's January 20, 2017 executive
order states:

"To the maximum extent permitted by
law, the Secretary of Health and Human
Services (Secretary) and the heads of
all other executive departments and
agencies (agencies) with authorities
and responsibilities under the
Act shall exercise all authority
and discretion available to them to
waive, defer, grant exemptions from,
or delay the implementation of any
provision or requirement of the Act
that would impose a fiscal burden on
any State or a cost, fee, tax, penalty,
or regulatory burden on individuals,
families, healthcare providers,
health insurers, patients, recipients
of healthcare services, purchasers of
health insurance, or makers of medical
devices, products, or medications."

To this IRS responded:

"Consistent with that, the IRS has
decided to make changes that would
continue to allow electronic and paper
returns to be accepted for processing
in instances where a taxpayer doesn’t
indicate their coverage status."

My professional tax software has
his option:

  taxpayer choose not to report
  healthcare status (set penalty
  to zero).

If you file on paper, do not check the
box on "Full-year coverage" in line 61
of Form 1040 if you do not have full
year coverage, and do not compute the
penalty either. Although the individual
mandate is still current law, but
IRS does not have power to enforce it
before or after the executive order as
the law says:

"(A) Waiver of criminal penalties

In the case of any failure by a
taxpayer to timely pay any penalty
imposed by this section, such taxpayer
shall not be subject to any criminal
prosecution or penalty with respect to
such failure.

(B) Limitations on liens and levies
The Secretary shall not —

(i) file notice of lien with respect to
any property of a taxpayer by reason of
any failure to pay the penalty imposed
by this section, or

(ii) levy on any such property with
respect to such failure."
